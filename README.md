# Simple React Native Example

This is just a simple React-Native app with react-native-sqlite-storage up and working. It is only configured for Android, not IOS.

Notes:
* The necessary changes to gradle and the java activity have been made
* A very simple SQLite database exists with one table: TEST. TEST has two columns: TEST_ID and TEST_NAME. TEST has a single row of data.
* I tried to put a few useful comments in the App.js file.

Good luck!
